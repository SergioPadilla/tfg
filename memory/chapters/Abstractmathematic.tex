\section{Abstract}

This work studies the isoperimetric problem in $\rtres$. It prove that a sphere has the smallest surface area per given volume in $\rtres$. To get this goal, it introduces the surfaces integration theory, variacional techniques and this work finishes proving that a sphere is the unique isoperimetric surface through the Wente's proof.
